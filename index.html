    This skyscraper's causing vertigo
    The countdown begins in Tokyo
    27 days alone means 20 million ways to cope
    Without you

    I'm in a reckless fever
    Lovestruck girl, I'd tease her
    Thought I'd never be her
    Quite the job you've done on me, sir
    You've been hosting parties in my mind
    I'm working overtime to have you in my world

    Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl
    Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down
    The independent lady in me is nowhere to be found

    I can't wait another day to see you
    How embarrassing to be this way
    I'm in a reckless fever
    Lovestruck girl, I'd tease her
    Thought I'd never be her
    Quite the job you've done on me, sir
    You've been hosting parties in my mind

    I'm working overtime to have you in my world
    Oh, what a curse it is to be in love
    I wait by the phone like a high school movie
    Dream at the shows you'll come running to me
    Think I see you in the wings
    God, I'm hallucinating

    What a reckless fever
    Lovestruck girl, I'd tease her
    Thought I'd never be her
    Quite the job you've done on me, sir
    You've been hosting parties in my mind
    I'm working overtime
    You've become my whole world
    Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover gir
